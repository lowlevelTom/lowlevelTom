Hi, I'm mainly working on DIY projects using mostly Arduino compatible boards and AVR MCUs programmed in AVR C or C++ 
(hopefully will start using some STM MCUs and dev boards, along with some others soon).
NOTE: I started using GitHub just recently so there might be no public repositories just yet.
